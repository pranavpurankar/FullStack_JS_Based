String	Primitive	Represents a sequence of characters or text.	let name = "Alice";
Boolean	Primitive	Represents logical values: true or false.	let isActive = true;
Undefined	Primitive	Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.	let value; // undefined
Null	Primitive	Represents an intentional absence of value, used to indicate "no value".	let result = null;
Symbol	Primitive	Unique and immutable identifier, often used as object property keys.	let id = Symbol("uniqueID");
Object	Non-Primitive	Collection of key-value pairs, used to store multiple values.	let person = { name: "Bob" };
Array	Non-Primitive	An ordered list of values, a type of object with indexed elements.	let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];

Terminology:

Expression :- JavaScript expressions are like phrases, it computes value
but doesn't do anything means it doesn't  alter the program state in any
way

Statement :- They don't have a value, but they do alter the state.
