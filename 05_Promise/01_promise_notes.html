        <h2>What is promise?</h2>
        <p>
            The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) 
            of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

            Hitesh defination: Jo bhi apane task diya hai, wo abhi ke abhi queue
            mein lagkar complete nhi hoga. Queue mein to lag gaya hai, lekin abhi
            usako load nhi gaya hai yani ke abhi complete nhi ho sakta.
            
            Hitesh Example: Javascript ke agale videoes ageyenge kab ayenge ye
            nahi pata but ayenge, jaise ayenge apko notification bell mein pata
            chal jayega. Agar nahi aye to aaj promise complete nhi hua hai, itani
            si hi to baat hai.

            <br>
            A promise is in one of these states:
            <ul>
                <li>pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected</li>
                <li>fulfilled: meanting that the operation was completed successfully</li>
                <li>rejected: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
            </ul>
            If you recall the XHR, we learned little about the states, and they are
            related to this concepts.
            <br>
            In the most of the operations you'll notice that promises are consumed,
            I mean you create promises also, but in the majority of cases you consume it.
            <br>
            Promises has two parts: (1) Cosuming promises (2) Creating promises
