Modules are a technique heavily used in today's software design/
architecture.

# What are modules and why are they useful?
A module is just a piece of code in a file that you can call and use
from other files. A modular design is the opposite of having all your
project's code in one single file.

/* 
# ES Modules

It is a standard that was introduced with ES6. The idea was to standari-
ze hos JS modules works and implement this features in browsers (which)
didn't previously support modules.

ESmodules is a more modern approach that is currently supported by
browsers and server-side apps with Node.

/* 
# Common JS :-
It is mainly used in server-side JS apps with Node, browser don't 
support the use of Common JS

Node used to only support Common JS to implement modules, but nowadays
it also supports ESmodules (a modern approach)
