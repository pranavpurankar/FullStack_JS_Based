In the async await part, are we consuming promise or not? It means promise is 
already created in fetchData, right? and by using async func we're consuming it,
right? Then inside async func why we are declaring variable data and calling 
fetchData()? Provide indepth answer and explanation with code using simple 
function. No mercy for wrong answer.

// Promise Creation
function fetchData(){
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(function (){
            resolve("Data fetched!");
        },2000);
    });
}

// Promise Consumption
fetchData()
    .then( function (data){
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch( function (error){
        console.log(error);
    });

// After: Using async/await

async function fetchDataAsync(){
    try{
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log(data)
    } catch{
        console.error(error);
    }
}

Great! Let’s dive into this step-by-step and break down your questions with a 
clear and thorough explanation.
What’s Happening Here?

You’ve provided a basic example where we have:

    A function fetchData() that returns a Promise.
    An example where you consume this Promise using .then() and .catch().
    Then, you move to an example using async/await to handle the same Promise 
    consumption.

Understanding Promises

Before we dive into the specifics of how async/await works, let’s understand what’s going on with Promises and their role.
Promise Creation (fetchData)

function fetchData(){
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(function (){
            resolve("Data fetched!");
        }, 2000);
    });
}

Here’s how this works:

    fetchData() returns a Promise. The Promise constructor takes a function (called an executor function) which has two parameters: resolve and reject. These are used to determine the outcome of the Promise.
    Inside the executor function, we simulate an asynchronous operation (in this case, a setTimeout of 2 seconds).
        If everything goes well (after 2 seconds), resolve("Data fetched!") is called, meaning the Promise will resolve with the string "Data fetched!".
        If something goes wrong, you would use reject(error) to reject the Promise with an error (but in this example, we're just resolving).
    The Promise is created when fetchData() is called, but it’s not resolved immediately; it resolves asynchronously (after the setTimeout).

Promise Consumption (using .then() and .catch())

fetchData()
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });

Here’s how .then() and .catch() work:

    fetchData() is called and returns a Promise.
    .then() is used to define what happens when the Promise is resolved (i.e., it successfully fetches the data). In this case, it logs the data ("Data fetched!").
    .catch() is used to handle any errors in case the Promise is rejected (but since we don't have rejection in this case, it’s just for safety).

So, in this case, you are consuming the Promise by handling the resolution (.then()) and any possible rejection (.catch()).
Using async/await

Now, let’s look at the async/await version:

async function fetchDataAsync() {
    try {
        const data = await fetchData();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

What’s happening here?

    async keyword:
        When a function is declared as async, it implicitly returns a Promise. This is important because it allows us to use the await keyword inside the function. Even though the function itself is async, it still returns a Promise.
    await keyword:
        The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It tells JavaScript to wait for the Promise to resolve (or reject) before continuing with the next line of code.
        Here, when you call await fetchData(), JavaScript pauses execution of fetchDataAsync until fetchData() resolves. Once it resolves, data will contain the resolved value ("Data fetched!").
        If fetchData() rejects, the error is thrown, and you can catch it using catch.

Key Points:

    Why do we declare const data = await fetchData(); inside fetchDataAsync?
        Even though fetchData() returns a Promise, using await is like saying, "Wait for this Promise to resolve, and then assign the result to data." If we didn’t use await, data would just be a Promise, not the resolved value. await ensures you’re getting the actual value.
    Why use try/catch?
        The try/catch block is used for error handling. If the Promise is rejected (e.g., an error occurs), the catch block will execute, logging the error.

Example Walkthrough (Step-by-Step):

Let's walk through the async/await version in more detail.
Step 1: Call fetchDataAsync()

fetchDataAsync();  // Start the async function

Step 2: Inside fetchDataAsync, Call fetchData() with await

const data = await fetchData();  // Pauses here until fetchData resolves

    JavaScript pauses and waits for fetchData() to resolve.
    During this pause, the event loop can handle other tasks if there are any.

Step 3: Handle the Resolved Value

Once the Promise from fetchData() resolves (after 2 seconds), the resolved value ("Data fetched!") is assigned to the data variable.

console.log(data);  // Logs "Data fetched!"

Step 4: Error Handling

If there’s any error (e.g., fetchData() was rejected or an error occurred in fetchDataAsync), the catch block will handle it.

catch (error) {
    console.error(error);  // Logs any errors
}

Recap: What’s Going on with async/await?

    Promise Creation: fetchData() creates a Promise that will resolve after 2 seconds.
    Promise Consumption:
        In the then/catch method, you manually handle the resolved or rejected state of the Promise.
        In async/await, you wait for the Promise to resolve using await, and you can work with the actual data directly (no need to use .then()).

By using async/await, you're writing asynchronous code in a way that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and understand.
Why Declare the data Variable?

When you use await, it returns the resolved value of the Promise. You need to store that value somewhere, and that’s why you declare the data variable. Without declaring data, you would have no way of accessing the result of the Promise.
Key Takeaways:

    Promise Creation: Happens when fetchData() is called, and it returns a pending Promise.
    Promise Consumption: You consume the Promise either with .then() or by using await inside an async function.
    await waits for the Promise to resolve and returns the resolved value, which you can then store in a variable (like data).

That’s the deep dive! Let me know if anything still feels unclear or if you'd like more details!
You said:
what is function executor and how it is different from normal function? Give in indepth explanation on it, what is this? It's working behind the scene and how it is used in the promise.
One more question, in fetchData(), it is a normal function right, the movement we introduce return new Promise..... it becomes promise, right? Do we need to write I mean always need to return Promise like above or is it necessary to always use same syntax function then return a new function from this, what is this mechanism?

Great questions! Let’s break them down one by one, starting with the concept of executor functions in the context of JavaScript Promises, followed by an explanation of how functions like fetchData() work, and how Promise creation works behind the scenes.
1. What is an Executor Function?

In JavaScript, when you create a Promise, you pass an executor function to the Promise constructor. This executor function is special and plays a critical role in Promise behavior. Let's define it clearly:

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // This is the executor function
});

Breakdown:

    Executor Function: The function that is passed to the Promise constructor is called the executor function.
    Parameters (resolve, reject): The executor function takes two parameters: resolve and reject, which are functions themselves.
        resolve: A function that you call when the asynchronous operation succeeds.
        reject: A function you call when the asynchronous operation fails (or if you want to indicate an error).

The executor function is responsible for starting the asynchronous operation and determining the outcome (success or failure) by calling resolve or reject accordingly.
Example of Executor Function in Action:

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      const data = "Data fetched successfully!";
      resolve(data);  // Mark the promise as resolved
    }, 2000);
  });
}

Here’s what’s happening:

    The executor function is the anonymous function passed to new Promise().
    It contains an asynchronous operation (setTimeout in this case), and once that operation is complete, it calls resolve(data) to resolve the Promise.

How is the Executor Different from a Normal Function?

A normal function:

    Just takes arguments and does something with them—whether it's synchronous or asynchronous.
    It doesn't inherently involve resolve and reject or work within the Promise mechanism.

An executor function in the context of a Promise:

    Is designed to handle asynchronous operations and explicitly tells the JavaScript engine whether the operation succeeded or failed by calling resolve() or reject().
    It is executed immediately when the Promise is created, and its purpose is to determine the eventual outcome of the Promise.

Key Difference:

    A normal function can return any value, while an executor function is expected to execute some asynchronous operation and call resolve or reject based on the outcome of that operation.
    The executor is invoked immediately when the Promise is created. In contrast, a normal function is invoked when explicitly called.

2. How Does fetchData() Become a Promise?

Let’s break down the fetchData() example you provided:

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      const data = "Data fetched successfully!";
      resolve(data);  // Resolve the promise with the data
    }, 2000);
  });
}

    Before the return new Promise(): fetchData() is just a regular function that doesn’t do anything asynchronous. It’s just a plain function that could return any value or nothing at all.
    When new Promise() is added: You’re wrapping the asynchronous logic inside a Promise.
        This Promise represents an operation that will complete in the future (either successfully or unsuccessfully).
        Inside the Promise, you're defining an executor function that runs immediately, starts some asynchronous work, and eventually either resolves or rejects the Promise.

The moment you return new Promise(), the function itself becomes a Promise-returning function, i.e., the Promise is the result of calling fetchData(), not just the inner workings of setTimeout.
Is It Always Necessary to Use new Promise()?

No, you don’t always need to manually create a Promise with new Promise() like this. However, if you're wrapping asynchronous logic inside a Promise and want to control the resolve/reject flow, you do need to use the Promise constructor.

But you don't always have to write it manually. Many built-in browser functions and modern JavaScript APIs (like fetch(), async/await, etc.) already return a Promise. So, you don’t need to use new Promise() every time, but you do when you need to wrap custom asynchronous logic in a Promise.
Example with Built-in Promise-Returning Functions:

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())  // This returns a Promise automatically
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

In this example, fetch() already returns a Promise, so we don’t need to manually create one.
3. Do We Always Need to Return a New Promise?

Not always. Here’s when you need to and don’t need to return a new Promise:
When You Do Need to Return a New Promise:

If you're dealing with asynchronous code and you need to control when the Promise resolves or rejects (like in fetchData()), then yes, you need to create a new Promise with new Promise() and use resolve() or reject() inside the executor.
Example:

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched!"), 2000);
  });
}

Here, you're manually creating the Promise and telling it when to resolve.
When You Don’t Need to Return a New Promise:

You don’t need to manually create a Promise if you’re using an API or a function that already returns a Promise. For example, modern JavaScript APIs like fetch, setTimeout, or async/await (when used in conjunction with async functions) all return Promises out of the box.
Example with setTimeout in Promise:

You could wrap setTimeout in a Promise if you needed to manually create a delay:

function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

delay(2000).then(() => console.log('Delayed for 2 seconds!'));

But setTimeout itself doesn’t return a Promise—you need to manually wrap it in a Promise if you want to use it with async/await or Promises in general.
4. Promise Mechanism
Basic Steps in the Promise Mechanism:

    Creation: When you create a new Promise, you pass in an executor function (a function with resolve and reject parameters).
    Execution: The executor function runs immediately and starts the asynchronous task.
    Resolution/Reject: Based on the task outcome, you call either resolve() (for success) or reject() (for failure).
    Consumption: The Promise is consumed using .then(), .catch(), or async/await to handle the resolved value or error.

Visualizing the Promise Flow:

    Promise Pending: Initially, the Promise is in a "pending" state.
    Resolve/Reject: After some time (asynchronous operation), it transitions to either "resolved" (fulfilled) or "rejected".
    Thenable: Once resolved or rejected, you can "consume" the result using .then() or .catch().

Example of the Lifecycle of a Promise:

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched!"), 2000);  // Resolving the Promise after 2 seconds
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then(data => console.log(data))  // Handling resolved state
  .catch(error => console.log(error));  // Handling rejected state

Key Takeaways:

    Executor Function: A special function passed to the Promise constructor that handles asynchronous operations and resolves or rejects the Promise.
    Promise Creation: Using new Promise() allows you to create a new Promise object that can resolve or reject asynchronously. Not every function requires you to manually create a Promise—many modern APIs already return Promises.
    When to Use new Promise(): You need to use new Promise() when you're working with custom asynchronous operations that need to be controlled manually (with resolve and reject).
    Built-in Promises: Functions like fetch(), setTimeout(), and async/await already return Promises, so you don't need to create them manually every time.

This should give you a thorough understanding of the executor function, the Promise mechanism, and how to use them effectively. Let me know if anything remains unclear or if you need more examples!
