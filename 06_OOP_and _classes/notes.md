# Javascript and classes

Technically speaking JS has no classes, but OOP is nothing but programming paradigm

## Good response from chatGPT

Yes, JavaScript have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015
specification (ES6). However, it's important to note that JS is primarily a prototype-based language, and ots classes are primarily syntatic sugar over existing
prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as c++/python, but under hood it works somewhat differently.

## OOP (Style of Programming)

## Object
- objects are collection of properties and methods. Ex properties are variables and methods are functions.
- toLowerCase, even though Promise is also object

## why use OOP?
Spaghetti code is a pejorative phrase for difficult-to-maintain and unstructured computer source code. Code being developed with poor structure can be due to any of several factors, such as volatile project requirements, lack of programming style rules, and software engineers with insufficient ability or experience.

To overcome this OOP and other programming styles are comes into the picture.


## Parts of OOP
Object literal -> you came across this word
literal meaning exact same thing that's it.

- Constructor function
- Prototypes/Proto
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars of OOP
- Abstraction {fetch is excellent example}
- Encapsulation {wrapping up data}
- Inheritance {inheritance parent child}
- Polymorphism {single method do many things}
