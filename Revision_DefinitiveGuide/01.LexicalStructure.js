/*
The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of
elementary rules that specifies how you write programs in that
language. It is the lowest-level syntax of a language: it specifies what
variable names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and
how one program statement is separated from the next, for example.

This short chapter documents the lexical structure of JavaScript. It
covers:

Case sensitivity, spaces, and line breaks
Comments
Literals
Identifiers and reserved words
Unicode
Optional semicolons
